# ESP32 Flood Detection System Setup

## Hardware Requirements

### Required Components:
- ESP32 Dev Board (ESP32-WROOM-32 or similar)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor (for water level detection)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- Power supply (USB or external)

### Optional Components:
- DHT22 Temperature/Humidity Sensor
- Waterproof enclosure
- Mounting hardware

## Wiring Diagram

### HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor:
```
HC-SR04    ESP32
VCC    ->  3.3V
GND    ->  GND
Trig   ->  GPIO 5
Echo   ->  GPIO 18
```

### DHT22 Temperature/Humidity Sensor (Optional):
```
DHT22   ESP32
VCC  ->  3.3V
GND  ->  GND
Data ->  GPIO 4
```

## Software Setup

### 1. Install Arduino IDE
- Download from: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
- Install ESP32 board support:
  - Go to File > Preferences
  - Add this URL to "Additional Board Manager URLs":
    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
    ```
  - Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager
  - Search for "ESP32" and install "ESP32 by Espressif Systems"

### 2. Install Required Libraries
Open Arduino IDE and install these libraries via Library Manager:
- **ArduinoJson** by Benoit Blanchon
- **DHT sensor library** by Adafruit
- **Adafruit Unified Sensor** by Adafruit

### 3. Configure the Code

Edit the following variables in `esp32_flood_sensor.ino`:

```cpp
// WiFi Configuration
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";           // Your WiFi network name
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";   // Your WiFi password

// Firebase Configuration
const char* firebaseUrl = "https://bahaba-a4a2e-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/readings.json";
const char* gateId = "north"; // Change to "south" or "east" for different gates
```

**Note**: The Firebase URL is already configured to point to your Firebase Realtime Database at [https://bahaba-a4a2e-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/](https://bahaba-a4a2e-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/). You only need to update your WiFi credentials.

### 4. Upload the Code
1. Connect ESP32 to your computer via USB
2. Select the correct board: Tools > Board > ESP32 Arduino > ESP32 Dev Module
3. Select the correct port: Tools > Port > (your ESP32 port)
4. Click the Upload button (â†’)

## Configuration Options

### Water Level Thresholds
Adjust these values based on your flood detection needs:

```cpp
const float LOW_THRESHOLD = 8.0;     // 8 inches - Low risk
const float MEDIUM_THRESHOLD = 13.0; // 13 inches - Medium risk  
const float HIGH_THRESHOLD = 20.0;    // 20 inches - High risk
```

### Reading Interval
Change how often readings are sent:

```cpp
const unsigned long readingInterval = 30000; // 30 seconds (in milliseconds)
```

### Gate IDs
Use different gate IDs for multiple sensors:
- `"north"` - North gate sensor
- `"south"` - South gate sensor  
- `"east"` - East gate sensor

## Firebase Data Format

The ESP32 sends JSON data directly to your Firebase Realtime Database at [https://bahaba-a4a2e-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/](https://bahaba-a4a2e-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/) in this format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "gateId": "north",
  "level": 12.5,
  "risk": "medium",
  "temperature": 25.3,
  "humidity": 65.2
}
```

The data is automatically stored in the `/readings` node of your Firebase database and will be accessible through your web application.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **WiFi Connection Failed**
   - Check SSID and password
   - Ensure WiFi network is 2.4GHz (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
   - Check signal strength

2. **API Connection Failed**
   - Verify API URL is correct
   - Check if your server is accessible
   - Ensure HTTPS certificate is valid

3. **Sensor Readings Incorrect**
   - Check wiring connections
   - Verify sensor is not obstructed
   - Calibrate distance measurements

4. **Code Upload Failed**
   - Hold BOOT button while uploading
   - Check USB cable (data cable, not just power)
   - Try different USB port

### Serial Monitor
Open Serial Monitor (Tools > Serial Monitor) to see debug output:
- Set baud rate to 115200
- Monitor connection status and sensor readings

## Deployment Tips

1. **Power Supply**: Use a stable power supply for continuous operation
2. **Enclosure**: Protect electronics from water and weather
3. **Mounting**: Position ultrasonic sensor at appropriate height
4. **Network**: Ensure stable WiFi connection at deployment location
5. **Maintenance**: Regular cleaning of sensors and checking connections

## Multiple Sensors

To deploy multiple sensors:
1. Change the `gateId` for each sensor
2. Use different mounting locations
3. Ensure each has unique network access
4. Monitor all sensors through your web dashboard
